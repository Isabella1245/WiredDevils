// the robot code is composed of mainly if statements.
// these if statements can get long
// the ternary operator can be applied in some cases, as a type of shortcut in replacement of an if statement.

// Example: look at this if statement (assume all buttons and variables are already stated)

if (yAxisLeft > deadband) {
  leftGroup.set(0.3);
  rightGroup.set(0.3);
}

// Now look at the same if statement, but instead I used a ternary operator

leftGroup = (yAxisLeft > deadband) ? 0.3 : 0;
rightGroup = (yAxisLeft > deadband) ? 0.3 : 0;
